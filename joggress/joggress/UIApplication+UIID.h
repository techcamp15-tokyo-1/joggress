@interface UIApplication (UIApplication_UIID)

/*! 
 @brief Returns the unique identifier for this installation of the application.
 @return The unique installation identifier generated for this installation of the application. If already generated before, returns that value.
 @discussion Note that the format of the returned value is UUID, which is completely different from that of UIDevice.uniqueIdnetifier.
 
 When the uniqueInstallationIdentifier is generated, its value will be as follows:
 * If UIDevice.identifierForVendor is available to use,
 ** UIDevice.dentifierForVendor.UUIDString if UIID_PERSISTENT=1.
 * Otherwise, CFUUIDCreateString is used to generate the value.
 
 The value of uniqueInstallationIdentifier will be reset when:
 * If UIDevice.identifierForVendor is available to use,
 ** The application is installed on the completely new device if UIID_PERSISTENT=1.
 ** The application is removed from the current device if UIID_PERSISTENT=0.
 ** You can't reset the value by using resetUniqueInstallationIdentifier anymore when UIID_PERSISTENT=1.
 * Otherwise,
 ** The application is installed on the completely new device without using any backups if UIID_PERSISTENT=1.
 ** The application is removed from the current device if UIID_PERSISTENT=0.
 
 This value is not aimed for sharing the same identifier among all applications installed on the same device (a.k.a. UDID). If you want to use UDID,
 * Use UIDevice.identifierForAdvertising instead if possible.
 * Otherwise, use any other UDID libraries available (I strongly discourage to do so!)
